# Mushroom_Body_Project
This MATLAB code corresponds to a forth coming paper (in collaboration with the Caron Lab, University of Utah School of Biological Sciences) on the effect of projection neuron-Kenyon cell (PN-KC) network structure on KC odor representations in the drosophila Mushroom Body. 

Running “MB_data_generation_shell.m” will compute Kenyon cell representations of an odor panel for a variety of degrees of “biases” and “grouping” in PN-KC networks. Similarly, running “pn2kc_network_generation.m” will produce a set of networks with a variety of degrees of biases and grouping.  “Recall_Capacity_Data_Generator.m” will, given a set of KC odor represenations, determine how many odor representation/behavioral outcome pairs the mushroom body can remember.
